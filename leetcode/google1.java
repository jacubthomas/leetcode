You are given an array A representing heights of students. All the students are asked to stand in rows. The students arrive by one, sequentially (as their heights appear in A). For the i-th student, if there is a row in which all the students are taller than A[i], the student will stand in one of such rows. If there is no such row, the student will create a new row. Your task is to find the minimum number of rows created.

Write a function that, given a non-empty array A containing N integers, denoting the heights of the students, returns the minimum number of rows created.

For example, given A = [5, 4, 3, 6, 1], the function should return 2.

Students will arrive in sequential order from A[0] to A[Nâˆ’1]. So, the first student will have height = 5, the second student will have height = 4, and so on.

For the first student, there is no row, so the student will create a new row.

Row1 = [5]

For the second student, all the students in Row1 have height greater than 4. So, the student will stand in Row1.

Row1 = [5, 4]

Similarly, for the third student, all the students in Row1 have height greater than 3. So, the student will stand in Row1.

Row1 = [5, 4, 3]

For the fourth student, there is no row in which all the students have height greater than 6. So, the student will create a new row.

Row1 = [5, 4, 3]

Row2 = [6]

For the fifth student, all the students in Row1 and Row2 have height greater than 1. So, the student can stand in either of the two rows.

Row1 = [5, 4, 3, 1]

Row2 = [6]

Since two rows are created, the function should return 2.

Assume that:

N is an integer within the range [1..1,000]

each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..10,000]

In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment
